# View Component: extensions, examples and development tools

This repository contains various code snippets and examples related to the [ViewComponent][] library. The goal of this project is to share common patterns and practices which we found useful while working on different projects (and which haven't been or couldn't be proposed to the upstream).

All extensions and patches are packed into a `view_component-contrib` _meta-gem_. So, to use them add to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "view_component-contrib"
```

## Installation and generating generators

**NOTE:** We highly recommend to walk through this document before running the generator.

The easiest way to start using `view_component-contrib` extensions and patterns is to run an interactive generator (a custom [Rails template][railsbytes-template]).

All you need to do is to run:

```sh
rails app:template LOCATION="https://railsbytes.com/script/zJosO5"
```

The command above:

- Installs `view_component-contrib` gem.
- Configure `view_component` paths.
- Adds `ApplicationViewComponent` and `ApplicationViewComponentPreview` classes.
- Configures testing framework (RSpec or Minitest).
- Adds required JS/CSS configuration.
- **Adds a custom generator to create components**.

The custom generator would allow you to create all the required component files in a single command:

```sh
bundle exec rails g view_component Example

# see all available options
bundle exec rails g view_component -h
```

**Why adding a custom generator to the project instead of bundling it into the gem?** The generator could only be useful if it fits
your project needs. The more control you have over the generator the better. Thus, the best way is to make the generator a part of a project.

## Organizing components, or sidecar pattern extended

ViewComponent provides different ways to organize your components: putting everyhing (Ruby files, templates, etc.) into `app/components` folder or using a _sidecar_ directory for everything but the `.rb` file itself. The first approach could easily result in a directory bloat; the second is better though there is a room for improvement: we can move `.rb` files into sidecar folders as well. Then, we can get rid of the _noisy_ `_component` suffixes. Finally, we can also put previews there (since storing them within the test folder is a little bit confusing):

```txt
components/                                 components/
  example_component/                          example/
    example_component.html                       component.html
  example_component.rb              â†’            component.rb
test/                                            preview.rb
  components/                                    index.css
    previews/                                    index.js
      example_component_preview.rb
```

Thus, everything related to a particular component (except tests, at least for now) is located within a single folder.

The two base classes are added to follow the Rails way: `ApplicationViewComponent` and `ApplicationViewComponentPreview`.

We also put the `components` folder into the `app/frontend` folder, because `app/components` is too general and could be used for other types of components, not related to the view layer.

Here is an example Rails configuration:

```ruby
config.autoload_paths << Rails.root.join("app", "frontend", "components")
```

### Organizing previews

First, we need to specify the lookup path for previews in the app's configuration:

```ruby
config.view_component.preview_paths << Rails.root.join("app", "frontend", "components")
```

By default, ViewComponent requires preview files to have `_preview.rb` suffix, and it's not configurable (yet). To overcome this, we have to patch the `ViewComponent::Preview` class:

```ruby
# you can put this into an initializer
ActiveSupport.on_load(:view_component) do
  ViewComponent::Preview.extend ViewComponentContrib::Preview::Sidecarable
end
```

#### Reducing previews boilerplate

In most cases, previews contain only the `default` example and a very simple template (`= render Component.new(**options)`).
We provide a `ViewComponentContrib::Preview` class, which helps to reduce the boilerplate by re-using templates and providing a handful of helpers.

The default template shipped with the gem is as follows:

```erb
<div class="<%= container_class %>">
  <%- if component -%>
    <%= render component %>
  <%- else -%>
    Failed to infer a component from the preview: <%= error %>
  <%- end -%>
</div>
```

To define your own default template:
```ruby
class ApplicationViewComponentPreview < ViewComponentContrib::Preview::Base
  # ...
  self.default_preview_template = "path/to/your/template.html.{erb,haml,slim}"  
  # ...
end
```

Let's assume that you have the following `ApplicationViewComponentPreview`:

```ruby
class ApplicationViewComponentPreview < ViewComponentContrib::Preview::Base
  # Do not show this class in the previews index
  self.abstract_class = true
end
```

It allows to render a component instances within a configurable container. The component could be either created explicitly in the preview action:

```ruby
class Banner::Preview < ApplicationViewComponentPreview
  def default
    render_component Banner::Component.new(text: "Welcome!")
  end
end
```

Or implicitly:

```ruby
class LikeButton::Preview < ApplicationViewComponentPreview
  def default
    # Nothing here; the preview class would try to build a component automatically
    # calling `LikeButton::Component.new`
  end
end
```

To provide the container class, you should either specify it in the preview class itself or within a particular action by calling `#render_with`:

```ruby
class Banner::Preview < ApplicationViewComponentPreview
  self.container_class = "absolute w-full"

  def default
    # This will use `absolute w-full` for the container class
    render_component Banner::Component.new(text: "Welcome!")
  end

  def mobile
    render_with(
      component: Banner::Component.new(text: "Welcome!").with_variant(:mobile),
      container_class: "w-25"
    )
  end
end
```

If you need more control over your template, you can add a custom `preview.html.erb` file.
**NOTE:** We assume that all examples uses the same `preview.html`. If it's not the case,
you can use the original `#render_with_template` method.

## Organizing assets (JS, CSS)

**NOTE*: This section assumes the usage of Webpack, Vite or other _frontend_ builder (e.g., not Sprockets).

We store JS and CSS files in the same sidecar folder:

```txt
components/
  example/
    component.html
    component.rb
    index.css
    index.js
```

The `index.js` is the controller's entrypoint; it imports the CSS file and may contain some JS code:

```js
import "./index.css"
```

In the root of the `components` folder we have the `index.js` file, which loads all the components:

```js
// components/index.js
const context = require.context(".", true, /index.js$/)
context.keys().forEach(context);
```

### Using with StimulusJS

You can define Stimulus controllers right in the `index.js` file using the following approach:

```js
import "./index.css"
// We reserve Controller for the export name
import { Controller as BaseController } from "stimulus";

export class Controller extends BaseController {
  connect() {
    // ...
  }
}
```

Then, we need to update the `components/index.js` to automatically register controllers:

```js
// We recommend putting Stimulus application instance into its own
// module, so you can use it for non-component controllers

// init/stimulus.js
import { Application } from "stimulus";
export const application = Application.start();

// components/index.js
import { application } from "../init/stimulus";

const context = require.context(".", true, /index.js$/)
context.keys().forEach((path) => {
  const mod = context(path);

  // Check whether a module has the Controller export defined
  if (!mod.Controller) return;

  // Convert path into a controller identifier:
  //   example/index.js -> example
  //   nav/user_info/index.js -> nav--user-info
  const identifier = path.replace(/^\.\//, '')
    .replace(/\/index\.js$/, '')
    .replace(/\//g, '--');

  application.register(identifier, mod.Controller);
});
```

We also can add a helper to our base ViewComponent class to generate the controller identifier following the convention above:

```ruby
class ApplicationViewComponent
  private

  def identifier
    @identifier ||= self.class.name.sub("::Component", "").underscore.split("/").join("--")
  end
end
```

And now in your template:

```erb
<!-- component.html -->
<div data-controller="<%= identifier %>">
</div>
```

### Isolating CSS with postcss-modules

Our JS code is isolated by design but our CSS is still global. Hence we should care about naming, use some convention (such as BEM) or whatever.

Alternatively, we can leverage the power of modern frontend technologies such as [CSS modules][] via [postcss-modules][] plugin. It allows you to use _local_ class names in your component, and takes care of generating unique names in build time. We can configure PostCSS Modules to follow our naming convention, so, we can generate the same unique class names in both JS and Ruby.

First, install the `postcss-modules` plugin (`yarn add postcss-modules`).

Then, add the following to your `postcss.config.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
  plugins: {
    'postcss-modules': {
      generateScopedName: (name, filename, _css) => {
        const matches = filename.match(/\/app\/frontend\/components\/?(.*)\/index.css$/);
        // Do not transform CSS files from outside of the components folder
        if (!matches) return name;

        // identifier here is the same identifier we used for Stimulus controller (see above)
        const identifier = matches[1].replace("/", "--");

        // We also add the `c-` prefix to all components classes
        return `c-${identifier}-${name}`;
      },
      // Do not generate *.css.json files (we don't use them)
      getJSON: () => {}
    },
    /// other plugins
  },
}
```

Finally, let's add a helper to our view components:

```ruby
class ApplicationViewComponent
  private

  # the same as above
  def identifier
    @identifier ||= self.class.name.sub("::Component", "").underscore.split("/").join("--")
  end

  # We also add an ability to build a class from a different component
  def class_for(name, from: identifier)
    "c-#{from}-#{name}"
  end
end
```

And now in your template:

```erb
<!-- example/component.html -->
<div class="<%= class_for("container") %>">
  <p class="<%= class_for("body") %>"><%= text %></p>
</div>
```

Assuming that you have the following `index.css`:

```css
.container {
  padding: 10px;
  background: white;
  border: 1px solid #333;
}

.body {
  margin-top: 20px;
  font-size: 24px;
}
```

The final HTML output would be:

```html
<div class="c-example-container">
  <p class="c-example-body">Some text</p>
</div>
```

## I18n integration (alternative)

ViewComponent recently added (experimental) [I18n support](https://github.com/github/view_component/pull/660), which allows you to have **isolated** localization files for each component. Isolation rocks, but managing dozens of YML files spread accross the project could be tricky, especially, if you rely on some external localization tool which creates these YMLs for you.

We provide an alternative (and more _classic_) way of dealing with translationsâ€”**namespacing**. Following the convention over configuration,
put translations under `<locale>.view_components.<component_scope>` key, for example:

```yml
en:
  view_components:
    login_form:
      submit: "Log in"
    nav:
      user_info:
        login: "Log in"
        logout: "Log out"
```

And then in your components:

```erb
<!-- login_form/component.html.erb -->
<button type="submit"><%= t(".submit") %></button>

<!-- nav/user_info/component.html.erb -->
<a href="/logout"><%= t(".logout") %></a>
```

If you're using `ViewComponentContrib::Base`, you already have translation support included.
Othwerwise you must include the module yourself:

```ruby
class ApplicationViewComponent < ViewComponent::Base
  include ViewComponentContrib::TranslationHelper
end
```

You can override the default namespace (`view_components`) and a particular component _scope_:

```ruby
class ApplicationViewComponent < ViewComponentContrib::Base
  self.i18n_namespace = "my_components"
end

class SomeButton::Component < ApplicationViewComponent
  self.i18n_scope = %w[legacy button]
end
```

## Hanging `#initialize` out to Dry

One way to improve development experience with ViewComponent is to move from imperative `#initialize` to something declarative.
Our choice is [dry-initializer][].

Assuming that we have the following component:

```ruby
class FlashAlert::Component < ApplicationViewComponent
  attr_reader :type, :duration, :body

  def initialize(body:, type: "success", duration: 3000)
    @body = body
    @type = type
    @duration = duration
  end
end
```

Let's add `dry-initializer` to our base class:

```ruby
class ApplicationViewComponent
  extend Dry::Initializer
end
```

And then refactor our FlashAlert component:

```ruby
class FlashAlert::Component < ApplicationViewComponent
  option :type, default: proc { "success" }
  option :duration, default: proc { 3000 }
  option :body
end
```

## Wrapped components

Sometimes we need to wrap a component into a custom HTML container (for positioning or whatever). By default, such wrapping doesn't play well with the `#render?` method because if we don't need a component, we don't need a wrapper.

To solve this problem, we introduce a special `ViewComponentContrib::WrapperComponent` class: it takes any component as the only argument and accepts a block during rendering to define a wrapping HTML. And it renders only if the _inner component_'s `#render?` method returns true.

```erb
<%= render ViewComponentContrib::WrappedComponent.new(Example::Component.new) do |wrapper| %>
  <div class="col-md-auto mb-4">
    <%= wrapper.component %>
  </div>
<%- end -%>
```

You can add a `#wrapped` method to your base class to simplify the code above:

```ruby
class ApplicationViewComponent < ViewComponent::Base
  # adds #wrapped method
  # NOTE: Already included into ViewComponentContrib::Base
  include ViewComponentContrib::WrappedHelper
end
```

And the template looks like this now:

```erb
<%= render Example::Component.new.wrapped do |wrapper| %>
  <div class="col-md-auto mb-4">
    <%= wrapper.component %>
  </div>
<%- end -%>
```

You can use the `#wrapped` method on any component inherited from `ApplicationViewComponent` to wrap it automatically:

## ToDo list

- Better preview tools (w/o JS deps ðŸ˜‰).
- Hotwire-related extensions.
